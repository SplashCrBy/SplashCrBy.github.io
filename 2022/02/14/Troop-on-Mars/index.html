<p>Playing with toys is one of the most common daily activities of children. Toddlers can improve their practical abilities and imagination through playing different kind of toys. However, our group realize that designing a toy is much more difficult than simply playing a toy because toy designers need to think over various aspects of a toy but not to rely on their intuitions in production. Specifically, a good toy should not only provide children enough interactivity but also possibility of collaboration. These characteristics are the radical sources that bring fun to children. The way of interaction ought to be very concise and intuitive for children so that they are able to understand some basic rules from randomly operating the system like pressing buttons in their own way by curiosity. “All the toys one commonly sees are essentially a microcosm of the adult world” (Jenks, 142). </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c0dRaxf.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></p>
<p>As a result, children will gradually become more and more familiar with the logic behind and finally master a new approach of interacting with the world. Besides, if a toy allows children to cooperate with each other, it can rapidly develop their communication skills during childhood, which enables children to talk spontaneously thus they will prefer to share their thoughts with their surroundings rather than keep silence. As Etienne Benson describes in his work, “Toys are opportunities for play, for exploration, and for social interaction; an educational toy that promotes these will have a positive effect, but so will an everyday household object — if used in the right way.” Therefore, our group decides to create a new type of remote control car which satisfies those criterions as far as possible, which leads to the starting point of our project.</p>

<p>To integrate such innovative experience for young players, we separate the whole remote-control section into two different parts, in other words, a navigator and a controller. The former is able to use his phone to view the frame transmitted by the camera on the car while the latter can only blindly control the car’s movement following the instruction of the navigator. We expect children to experience different characters to distinguish both advantages and disadvantages of those two characters instead of particularly concentrating on single player experience. Hence, they can learn from their experiences and then guide the other player effectively after numbers of trial. Consequently, we find out that our game should be challenging enough in order that collaboration will become player’s first choice. For that reason, NASA’s remotely Control Planetary Rover and Djedi robot inspires us a lot in our project. They both use multiple sensors and camera to explore unknown area around the world, which grants user to observe an area from different angle through the camera. It is difficult for a child to operate such robot on his own. Nonetheless, the appearances of those robots are too mechanical to be attractive to children so we creatively add a screen to show the emotion status of our car. It can constantly change along with the car’s behavior so that it will trigger children’s thirst of probing how many facial expressions the car could have. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sAZibmD.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload> </p>
<p>Accordingly, the context of our game is set on Mars. Players can imagine that they are controlling a space exploration Rover from Earth to find human being’s temporary base on that red planet. Because of “some loss in data transmission”, players can easily perceive the lag existing in both frame transmission and inputting commands. Namely, it requires a certain level of cooperation between the navigator and the controller to clear the game. So, during the game, it might spend both sides a lot of time and energy on determining the subtle balance. Although it is totally possible for them to complain about each other, they are actually communicating and solving the problem together. As Luisa Magalhaes and Jeffrey Goldstein states in their book, “The specificity of the toys, and beyond that of games, is to provide fun education, associated with entertainment, or at the very least to display this in the discourse accompanying the toy and in the toy itself, as we have seen” (44). This is the key concept that continuously affects our project. By alternately acting as navigator and controller, players will slowly get accustomed to the mechanism of the game and become more patient to other’s fault as they also understand what they are suffering. Thus, they will rather encourage their teammates and help them out of trouble, which is exactly a successful team should look like.</p>

<p>For the sake of user friendly interface and lightweight design, we use Raspberry Pi 3 as the motherboard but not Arduino because Arduino’s CPU is not powerful enough to handle massive calculation and does not support Real-time task well assigned by users. In addition, Raspberry Pi already provides all kinds of ports including GPIO, USB and other popular interfaces so it is relatively more convenient to use Raspberry Pi especially when we are not capable of setting up our complex circuit with Arduino. As a consequence, we just need to write Python program to drive the motor and screen because they are both connected to the GPIO side of Raspberry Pi. The other components such as chassis and wheels are all made of plastics as this kind of material is safe for children and can remarkably reduce the total weight of the car. Moreover, since Raspberry Pi has wireless module, we can directly transfer the video data from camera to navigator’s cellphone as a portable monitor through wireless networks. On the other hand, controllers can use either keyboard or DualShock 4 controller to control the car. Their mission is to drive the car back to its base under efficient collaboration between players. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/70DdSqW.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></p>
<p>What’s more, due to the high customizability of the screen, users can display whatever they want on that LED screen. That is to say, the screen not only simulates the way how scientist communicate with extraneous creatures but in real life also enables child to interact with the world in a different way. For example, during the game, if the navigator accidentally sees his parents on his phone, he can ask his partner to show some greetings on the screen. Clearly such feature can imperceptibly promote family relationships and friendships, which makes the car more than a toy but a communication tool which connects everyone together into one place. Like Rodney P. Carlisle says, “Many scripts come from children’s own observations of adult life, and fantasy play has often been considered direct preparation for adult roles” (225). In other words, children are willing to sharing their perspectives because their subconsciousness know they should practice such skills. The screen on the car provides them a platform to talk with other people by using not only texts but also emoji to express themselves, which makes them well prepared for their adulthood.</p>
<p>We once worried about whether children will like our project or not because it is essentially still a remote-control car. Youngster nowadays may prefer to play with electronic devices like iPad rather than such classic toy in our generation. Fortunately, we receive many positive feedbacks from those young visitors. They begin to communicate with their partners to find the best solution as soon as they understand the responsibility of their corresponding characters. It looks like a moveable car is appealing for children as usual. Not to mention the sense of achievement they can earn after overcoming the difficulties they have met during the game. Nevertheless, we also find some shortages in our project through observing their playing progress. Firstly, our remote-control car does not have excellent handling. We notice that even a pair of player know exactly what they are going to do next, the car will not respond to their command in the same way as they may have expected. Such kind of imperfection might significantly frustrate players. In consequence, we will add a switch that allows player to modify the sensitiveness of the handling. Secondly, if there is only tiny space for playing, we would like to include an extra opaque cover in the container as we want to make sure that controller is not able to directly see the car otherwise it will ruin the whole game experience of both side. Besides, we decide to do more research on the camera to check if it can support night vision so our toy could be played at any time anywhere.</p>
<p>In conclusion, through making a toy by ourselves, we have understood the basic ideas about how to create an interactive product for specific age group. Balancing the boundary between interesting and educating purposes requires us to make a detailed plan before we make the prototype. Furthermore, we can rely on the feedbacks from our target audiences even in the middle of our production to define a goal for our next iteration. In a nutshell, evaluating our own project undoubtedly makes us know the development process and we can implement such valuable experiences into our future works.</p>
